      <p>Love.</p>

      <p>What is love?</p>

      <p>There are many types of love and the word itself can be used to express a sublime feeling of goodwill towards a kind-faced stranger, all the way up to, and beyond, the emotionally charged compulsion a soldier experiences as he sacrificially throws himself upon a grenade, his brothers-in-arms looking on in slack-jawed astonishment.</p>

      <p>But, let's stick with the notion of romantic love.  This is a little bit more specific, but not by much. Here too, there are many varieties and notions of what this word means and no matter how much effort is spent trying to specifically define it, we cannot. Even efforts at defining the borders within which anything that exists can be called love is a difficult affair.</p>


      <p>Let's try.</p>

      <p>Conventional wisdom says that the purpose of romantic love is to experience the company of someone, to whom you feel an attraction, for as long as is possible. If and when this attraction wanes, for one reason or another, then we say we have "fallen out of love."  Notice the wording of the previously quoted phrase. It uses the word "fallen."  Almost as if to be experiencing the sensation of love is akin to flight or, at least, floating above the ground. In other words, love is a major emotion and, by extension, something that could also be called a _peak_social_experience_. But, the emphasis is placed upon what "you" are feeling. Most people would say that you aren't in love unless you have this feeling of having "fallen in love."</p>

      <p>No feeling of a _peak_social_experience_ = "no love".</p>

      <p>What brings on this feeling of a _peak_social_experience_? Scientists have shown that when we describe ourselves as being "in love" our brains are being flooded by elevated levels of oxytocin, dopamine, norepinephrine and phenylethylamine and this experience can mimic snorting a rail of crystal meth (increased heart and breathing rates, dialated pupils, and sweating). Still though, another question remains wagging its finger in our faces.  What is it that triggers our body to start kicking its dust up like this?</p>

      <p>Freud was one of the first to break our primary motivations, as a species, into two distinct driving forces, Eros and Thanatos; the love (or life force) and the death force. He believed that we were pulled between the interplay of these two forces.  The Thanatos was responsible for and ensures that the older generation "get out of the way" of subsequent generations and is responsible for self-destructive behavior. The Eros works as a counter-force to Thanatos -- speaking from a species-survival oriented viewpoint: it is what pushes us forward; getting married, raising a family and doing the things necessary for the propagation of our species.</p>

      <p>So when we combine physical manifestations with metaphysical theory, we are left with a definition that says love is merely a bio-chemical attraction, combined with cultural and societal norms whose only purpose is to increase the chances of survival of the individual's DNA and, by extension, the larger society's chances of survival.</p>

      <p>But we are more then a mere collection of primal animal and bio-electrical forces.  And while these things may play major roles in our experiences of what is called love, there is another contributing cluster of factors --our minds and their volitional forces; our unique experiences, our perceptions and interpretations of our environment, our free-will, our individual personalities.  All these things interplay with our neurotransmitters and cultural memories.</p>

      <p>Psychologist Dorothy Tennov, first introduced the term "limerence" in her book Love and Limerence: The Experience of Being in Love published in 1979.</p>
 
      <p>Limerence is a state of affairs in which one or both persons in a relationship not only expect sex but also the reciprocation of feelings and actions popularly associated with "being in love." It can be considered infatuation, compressed and realized.  The expectations in this case are of a highly-charged emotional nature -the perception of "falling in love" again.</p>

      <p>For some, these feelings become irrational and, even, obsessive.</p>

      <p>Tennov's research showed that limerence can last up to about 18 months, but typically lasts for only a few. Either it is replaced by other feelings (genuine friendship exclusive of sex, an exclusively sexual relationship, disappointment / hatred, a more resilient form of love, etc.) or it ends when one or both parties, for one reason or another, quit participating in the tit-for-tat nature of this style of relationship.</p>

      <p>Remember:  limerence is highly dependent upon the act of reciprocation to continue its existence.</p>

      <p>It's self-centered.</p>

      <p>It's rigid.</p>

      <p>It's consumption-oriented.</p>

      <p>It's dependent upon another person's actions for its existence.</p>

      <p>I feel limerence is what most people are thinking of when they think of love.  Sure, it might be considered a stepping-stone on the path towards love. But, I don't think it's the ultimate form of love.</p>

      <p>In the end, love (as it is commonly understood) is an ever-evolving thing that can come in as many unique and diverse varieties as there are individuals in existence and, although the word itself may be difficult to precisely define, what is undeniable is its existence and what must be understood is the relative validity of each person's interpretation of it.</p>

      <p>Having made this concession though, it must be said that for most of us our current understandings of love are feeble and unrealistic. By the time most of us realize this, it is too late. Some of us end up in loveless marriages that were motivated by something that was unable to endure for the long haul. Or perhaps for some of us, love is something fragile and ephemeral. A feeling of euphoria that is also unable to endure past the first sign of trouble on the horizon.</p>

      <p>In my opinion, truly authentic forms of love have been slain by recent forms of popular entertainment, with its necessity to compress and dramatize reality, people are left with warped perceptions of how people fall in love and the unrealistic expectation of "living happily ever after."  Popular psychology is equally culpable.  With books like _Women That Love Too Much_, and _Co-dependent No More_, Dr. Phil and others, with their subtle bending of perspectives to garner the ratings of the target retired, divorced, or stay-at-home person audience, are also to blame for the popular notion that, "My love should be perfect, effortless and always fulfilling." Pop Marketing completes this vicious cycle. In between sessions of TV shows, while we drive on the freeway, wait in line at the grocery store, read the newspaper, and, even, use the restroom, we are being targeted and spoken to by removed manipulators that know exactly who we are, what we want and how to leverage that to their benefit.  They can tell this just by virtue of the fact that we are somewhere that they are. Every moment of our lives is being invaded by these subtle influences that contribute towards telling us that love is something that it isn't.</p>

      <p>In Toto:  love is caring, but not so caring as to not stand up and kick some ass at times.  So, what happens when some angry bitch or some abusive asshole get a hold of this philosophy?  Well, let's just call it a variation on the "my love knows no bounds" idea. In other words, "my love knows no bounds...except for here...oh, and here...oh and here....oops, almost forgot about this boundary." These boundaries can be twisted and perverted to include anything that the definer, selfishly and capriciously, insists they are.</p>

      <p>Love is all about possession, status, ownership and control...unless it turns into selfless love.</p>

      <p>Robert Sternberg, the Dean of Arts and Sciences at Tufts University and former IBM Professor of Psychology and Education at Yale University, has proposed what he calls the "Triangular Theory of Love."  In it, he proposes that love can be explained and categorized according to the combination of three main elements; intimacy, passion, and commitment. The more elements a relationship has, the greater its ability to survive, and Sternberg has devised a table naming the types of relationship possible according to which combination of these elements it contains.</p>

      <p>A relationship, in the vast majority of cases, starts off with passion, usually in the form of emotional, physical attraction -- limerence. Passion combined with intimacy results in romantic love (example_guy #1:  (while achieving orgasm inside the object of his affection) "I've never lasted this long before!").  Passion combined with commitment results in fatuous love (example_guy #2: "I know this is crazy and everything (cause we just met tonight over by the roulette table) but let's boogie on over to the Elvis Presley / Buddhist / Drive-Thru Wedding Chapel and GET MARRIED!"). Intimacy and commitment devoid of passion is companionate love (example_guy #3: "Hey honey, would you mind popping this pimple on my back.  I can't get at it.") --there are more. But the most important one, in my opinion, is the one Sternberg calls consummate love.  This is the only type of love that contains intimacy, passion and commitment.  Sternberg considers this the ideal type of love relationship although he also points out, not only is it the hardest type of love to achieve but it is, also, the most difficult to maintain.  "Without expression even the greatest of loves can die."</p>

      <p>Because, in the end love is not a sensation or an experience, in order for it to have any lasting meaning or validity (meaning that it is able to withstand hardships and not just survive but flourish), it must be a verb. There must be truly selfless actions that accompany it, actions devoid of any ulterior motives.  It is during this that one can say they are "being loving" and not just "in love."</p>

      <p>True love isn't selfish.</p>
      <p>It's selfless.</p>
      <p>It's adaptive.</p>
      <p>It's contribution-oriented.</p>
      <p>It exists independent of anything outside of itself.</p>

      <p>So, after having arrived to an ideal definition of love, we are left asking ourselves, "Is it worth it?" Ah, the million dollar question. Will you ask the audience, will you ask a friend, will you depend upon the process of elimination? And sure, it's okay to say that there is more then one horseshoe crab in the ocean, and that you will eventually step upon love when you least expect it, but then you realize that while possibilities are endless, your own personal length of time treading across this planet is not. You will grow old.  Do you want to be alone at the end? Are you sure?</p>

      <p>In the end, all other factors, being equally valid at the level of "essences," doesn't it just come down to us being selfish?  We don't want to grow old alone. We want to perpetuate our DNA. We want someone with whom we can share our problems, victories and experiences.  We WANT someone that will be there for us. We might kid ourselves about being mature enough to not really need anybody else or that the love that we have with this other person is generous and open. But is it really?  When the chips are really down, don't we all really just want someone to replace our positive, parental figure and provide us with the feeling that we are important, individual and worthy?</p>

      <p>Here's a BIG reason people fall in love: to have a family. Think about it. Whenever you start something a good practice is to ask yourself, "Where will this end up?" So, let's say you fall in love with someone.  Then what, well the next thing you know you're finding their toothbrush to one side of your sink, even after they've left for the day. Then you're looking at apartments together, or she's moving in with you or you're moving in with her. Then boom, she's pregnant even though she told you she was on the pill and you decided not to wear a rubber and she wrapped her legs around you and wouldn't let you pull out. Boom! You're looking at sonic-grams and deciding what to name it. Then you've got a full time job that fucking sucks and another little responsibility on the way.</p>

      <p>Or fuck that, you've got a chance at making a beautiful life with a beautiful person, someone that will allow us to be a responsible, well-adjusted member of society. Nobody trusts the eternal bachelor and the old spinster gets burned at the stake for witch-craft.</p>

      <p>But, hey man, it's all a crap shoot and in the end you're fucking around with heaps and heaps of powerful shit; stuff that involves other peoples' lives.</p>

    <p class="italic">She fidgets with her chopsticks and stares out the window as she says, "Love is something that you give out.  The more you give out the more will come back to you. But, sometimes things turn out that make you feel as though you shouldn't share your love with others.  Then you become lost and feel like there is no love in the world."</p>

    </br>

    <p id="center_element" class="bold">/// --- x X x --- \\\</p>

    </br>

    <p>Ah, but take off your lab coat of apathy and set down your sliderule of jaded bitterness and a different understanding is possible.  Perhaps love, like all other things, is transient and mutable.  I mean, what did you expect? What were you taught?  Did you watch your parents fight like dogs and cats growing up?  Who was in charge?  All of your experiences growing up, religion, television, pornography, stories, fairy tales, histories, the news, conversations you might have had with your friends, the music to which you listen.  All of these things influence your attitudes and perceptions.</p>

    <p>Ensure that you aren't coming out of a bad relationship, or tired of seeing all your friends pair up, or just plain lonely, or that you aren't going through any periods in your life that are best tended to while solo. It's at these times, when we are vulnerable, that we make decisions we regret. A UFO could drop out of the clouds spilling Bigfoot into your balcony carrying a sign reading "I HAVE THE ANSWER!!" and you would believe it.</p>

    <p>People decide for themselves who they will love. And what criterion do they use to make this decision?  It is still, mostly a question of compatibility.  I see the mentally-handicapped holding hands on the bus, dirty, busted down junkies rolled up together in an embrace inside a filthy sleeping bag, dressed up well-heeled couples smiling as they carry their beautiful children into a church on a sunny day.  The world is a big place and I believe there is someone for everyone.</p>

    <p>Some people have proposed that it is when you are open for it, but not actively hunting for it is when it is most likely to happen.  This is the "go with the flow" viewpoint that says when you are ready the partner will appear. Does it work?  Maybe, but that doesn't seem to stop people from actively tinkering with the process on their own, speed dating, matchmakers, Yahoo! groups, internet dating services, local alternative newspaper classified ads, Craig's List, chat rooms, message boards, singles' groups based off of a person's interests, hobbies, and viewpoints.  But, what about a person that doesn't fall into easily categorized groups?  The answer to this is that there is someone for everyone, even if that someone is an anarcho-capitalist, macram‚ weaving, hang-gliding, Zoroastrian, gun enthusiast.  This person has someone that he/she can relate to, so long as they both have the capacity to be human...or at least human in the same manner.</p>

    <p>Now go and find someone else like this.  Don't settle for someone simply because, they are good looking, or smart, or stylish dressers or say witty things.  Although, these things are good (and enough in and of themselves for some), they are the icing on the cake, the glitter sparkling around the substance.  The substance is, once again, their ability to be human in the same way that you define "being human."</p>

    <p>The idea behind love is that you find someone with whom you have a great deal in common.  Let's lay aside for now the variety of conventional wisdom that says "opposites attract."  I think we've all seen what happens when opposites end up getting into a long-term relationship.  At best, there is a grudging respect that mirrors love only in its ability to hang on and not give up.  But, this is a kind of love that settles - Sternberg's notion of companionate love in the best case scenario.</p>

    <p>What a terribly complicated thing.  Like all things though, the hard things are the ones most worth doing.  If you wanted to do something like be a marine biologist, Hollywood stuntman, learn Sanskrit, or mine your own silicon, wouldn't all of these things carry an inherent risk?  Couldn't a scuba tank rupture, a car flip over and kill you, maybe Sanskrit is too hard for you abilities, maybe you'd die in a cave in deep underneath the Earth's crust somewhere?  Do you see where this is going?  All things come with a risk, no?</p>

    <p>Is it difficult to find a good match for yourself?  Yes.  But, it really depends on how selective you are.  If you were a biker how hard would it be for you to pick a leather jacket?  How about if you were a dentist with a Harley he only takes out of the garage during the months of July to August? How about a homeless man living on the streets in Chicago in January?  So, you say, "a-HA! It's Eddie Murphy's Saltines joke."  Maybe, but although metaphors and similes are helpful, love isn't a leather jacket.  The explanation or analogy isn't the truth or the experience itself.  It is merely the proverbial Zen finger pointing at the Zen moon.</p>

    <p>And what are the criteria that most people use to measure their attraction? Sure, it's easy to mock the flip-flop-wearing, "No Fear" mud-flaps crowd and say they are shallow because they judge one another by the size of their biceps, wallets and tits.  But are others that much different? Won't a guy wearing a set of foam rubber Spock ears propose just as easily to a girl in a Lara Croft outfit at a Gen Con convention?  Aren't the emotional states each one of them is feeling equally valid or invalid?</p>

    <p>The question seems to become:  how much of a catch are you yourself? The more attributes that you have that are in complete alignment with the popular perception of what attributes a "catch" has. Are you attractive? Do you have loads of money? Are you comfortable in social situations? Are you intelligent?  How about emotionally stable?  Do you have a fantastic sense of humor? Do you love long walks on the beach at sunset?  Do you like chocolate ice cream? Will you watch football games or marathon sessions of _The Simpsons_ or _Star Search_?  The more questions you can answer with a "Yes," the higher your chances are of finding a mate.</p>

    <p>It's the law of averages and probability.</p>

    <p>After this, it is mostly a question of tactics matching, the one to the other. In other words, a nerd will mostly likely do things that another nerd will find attractive.  A person that is into going to the gym and then spending the night watching reality TV, can most likely do no wrong in the eyes of a potential mate that is the same way (read:  they have the same kinds of personalities).</p>

    <p id="center_element" class="bold">/// --- x X x --- \\\</p>

    <p class="italic">"Love is a four letter word that must never be spoken," he answers jokingly.</p>

    <p class="italic">He settles back into his chair and then looks at me thoughtfully. He has worked hard the last few years to work his way up to middle-management. He works six days a week, sometimes seven and he spends his free time watching sports and playing video games. He has a wife and a son, another child is on its way. He seems content and calm.</p>

    <p class="italic">"It all comes down to what a person's expectations are. Think of it like this: the American Dream is the world's biggest hypocrisy. Why? Because, the American Dream is really about being content with what you have. If you take away a person's dreams, what do they have?  Really good sleep. So, do you understand?  Do you see how not having a dream is the ultimate dream?"</p>

    <p class="italic">He looks at me with a straight face for a few moments before busting out into laughter.</p>

    </br>

    <p id="center_element" class="bold">/// --- x X x --- \\\</p>

    </br>

    <p>It comes down to what you expect.  How realistic are your notions? If your notions are unrealistic, is the fantasy sustainable over a long period of time?  Do you want it to be?  Do you feel that, sometimes, it's an act of love to fight?  How about being silent and attentive?  Have you considered some of the pitfalls?  Do you share enough of the same viewpoints about the IMPORTANT things? How about money?  How about sex? How about raising the kids? Oh yeah, did you want kids?</p>

    <p>Think deeply on what it is to be selfless and independent at the same time, learn what it is to be patient, forgiving and make mutual sacrifices. Realize that sometimes love is ugly, bitter and hateful. It is getting through these times that we get to the flip-side of the coin that is love. And love does have two sides.  To ignore this is to fall into error and lose your way. You must be able to respond with an action when you hear sentences that begin like this: "I don't have the...", "I have a secret I need to share with you...", "Would you forgive me if I told you...?"  You must be able to answer with, "Here take mine...", "I love you no matter what you tell me. Your secret is safe with me," "I forgive and forget what has happened." You have to be able to do these things even when you don't want to.</p>

    <p>You must pick someone that can do the same thing for you --"Without expression even the greatest loves can die."</p>

    <p>Also, be on the lookout for taking this too far.  A significant other that is physically abusive, belittles you, or attempts to use you for what you can do rather then for what you are is something else that must be guarded against. There are many people in the world, which for one reason or another, are unable to reciprocate love. It is in these moments that you must be on guard against love that is primarily physical or lustful in nature. A bad relationship can ruin your life for years, in exactly the ways that you have been warned about.</p>

    <p>Be independent.  Be sure that you maintain your individuality. Be sure that when you change it is only in positive ways.  Leave the rest of yourself as it was. Never let another person change you.  If you were to change into something different than what you were when you met another, how can that person claim to have fallen in love with the original you?  If someone else insists on changing you, refuse them and break up.</p>

    <p>Honesty and authenticity are also of major importance.  Without this, there can be no trust and without trust it is not long before the most passionate of relationships fall into decay and self-implosion.</p>

    <p>But, many factors play against this.  The chief of which is that we are unable to understand that love is not something TO BE maintained --meaning that it can't always be the way we want it to be. Love isn't a Victorian English garden meant to be bent to our will and signify our conquest of nature; it is a chaotic, fluid wildflower garden blooming in a box canyon somewhere in the desert. People argue, discoveries are made, crises occur that cause strains upon relationships. It is during these crises that love changes from something romantic or emotional into something that can be said to be deeper...more authentic. It is at the moment that love undergoes the transformation from romantic to selfless that it can be called Love with a capital "L."</p>

  <p class="italic">It is late at night or early in the morning, depending upon your personal sleep sleep schedule. His birth name is not Dustin but it is the one that he took when he arrived in America with his parents from Taiwan.</p>

  <p class="italic">He is 33 years old and has been with is girlfriend Patricia, off and on, for over seven years. This last stretch has gone on for over three years. Patricia wasn't her birth name either, but you get the picture.</p>

  <p class="italic">Patricia isn't sitting at a table outside on this hospital's patio.  She is inside the large, brown, stucco box holding their sleeping, two-hour old daughter Kayla in her arms.  He tells me this as he sits smoking a cigarette and contemplates the enormity of this night in his life.  He tells me that seeing her give birth to their daughter Kayla has made him appreciate his wife more. He understands her suffering; a mother's commitment.</p>

  <p class="italic">We talk for a long time.</p>

  <p class="italic">"Most people keep quiet," he tells me in broken English, "It's frustrating. You don't understand why she sad and you want to know.  The secret is to talk."  He flicks some ashes from his partially burnt cigarette onto the ground. "When we have problems we go to the temple.  It's good because you don't have to go every week, only when you want to or if you have problem." He trails off for a moment and stares into a distant window on the fifth floor of the hospital; the neo-natal care floor.</p>

  <p class="italic">The sky is nothing but feathery clouds alight with angel-fire now and, with the innocence and intensity of a caveman, he says, "Safe feelings, find peace there. Remember, why."</p>
