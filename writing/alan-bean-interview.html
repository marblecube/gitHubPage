<h3>THE LATERALIZATION OF LT. CMDR. ALAN BEAN</h3>
<p>by Vidal Palacios</p>

<div class="writing-inner">

<div class="italic-and-bold">
<p>Imagine this: You are being shaken violently by 7.5 million pounds of thrust pushing out of five F1 rocket engines somewhere behind you, and thirty six and a half seconds after lifting off from the Kennedy Space Center atop a Saturn V, every warning indicator on your control panel simultaneously lights up, fuel-cell disconnect flags pop, and your instrumentation malfunctions.</p>
<p>Seventeen and a half seconds later, the “8-ball” attitude indicator begins spinning wildly, the telemetry stream from Mission Control is garbled, and, since there aren’t any windows, it’s impossible for you to see what’s happening.</p>
<p>It’s November 14, 1969 and you are one of three astronauts on America’s Apollo 12 mission –the second mission in the history of humankind to venture towards the Moon.</p>
<p>Your entire life has been prelude to this moment.</p>
<p>The world is watching.</p>
<p>You are the spacecraft systems engineer.</p>
<p>And you have no idea what’s happening.</p>

<blockquote>
      “Some of the things you cannot do in painting that you can do in prose. If you want to talk about Fear –I would love to do a painting that shows the kind of latent fear, or the heightened awareness when you’re an astronaut in a space suit on the lunar surface. That, you know, if a little meteorite comes through your suit you’re dead, or if somebody didn’t do the sewing of the zipper right, or something like that, you could die. You don’t dwell on it, but you do have knowledge of that and so it gives you a heightened awareness, and so you can’t –I haven’t figured out a way to show it and I haven’t seen any other artist that can show it either. So, there’s certain things that you can’t show.”

<h2>Left-Brain: Aeronautical Engineer, Fighter Pilot, Test Pilot, and Astronaut</h2>

<p>Alan Bean was born in in Wheeler, Texas, on March 15, 1932 to Arnold and Frances Bean. He had one sibling, a sister named Paula.</p>

<p>After graduating from Paschal High school in Fort Worth, Texas he went on, in 1955, to receive a Bachelor of Science degree in aeronautical engineering from the University of Texas. During his time at UT, he was a Navy ROTC Student, and upon completing college received his commission as a Navy officer and began fighter pilot training.</p>

<p>After a four-year tour of duty assigned to an attack squadron in Jacksonville, Florida, he completed test pilot training at the United States Naval Test Pilot School located at Patuxent River, Maryland. The alumni list of this program reads like a who’s who of astronauts involved in the early US space program and includes Alan Sheppard and John Glen among many others.</p>

</div>

<p>In 1963, Bean was selected as a member of Astronaut Group 3 by NASA, and in 1967, following the death of Astronaut Clifton Williams in an airplane crash, he was selected by Commander Charles “Pete” Conrad, Jr. (a former instructor of Bean’s in test pilot flight school) as his replacement for Lunar Module Pilot on Apollo 12 and joined Richard F. Gordon, Jr. as Command Module Commander to complete the three man crew.</p>

<p>After his visit to the Moon, Bean would go on to become spacecraft commander of Skylab 3, and after retiring from the Navy as a captain, was head of the Astronaut Candidate Operations and Training Group. He resigned from NASA in 1983.</p>

<h2>Right-Brain: Artist and Painter</h2>

<p>At the same time he was training to become a naval test pilot he began taking night school courses in watercolor and drawing at nearby St. Mary’s College.</p>

<p>He experimented with abstract art for a while, and then realism before settling on the impressionistic style he currently uses.<p>

<p class="bold">RED BLUE SHIFT:<p class="italic"> What do you hope future generations will get from your art? What do you see as your artistic legacy?<p></p>
<p class="bold">ALAN BEAN:<p class="italic"> Well, what I’m hoping –I left the space program to tell
the stories that I remember from this great adventure, one of the great human explorations of all time, not the greatest, maybe, but one of the greatest, and so, I’m hoping to just leave more information about it; more celebration of an amazing accomplishment, more understanding of what we we were able to accomplish. What ordinary humans are able to do accomplishing an impossible dream if they’re willing to, you know, work together, and sacrifice, and continue to move towards their goals. And I think there’s a huge lesson there. I know there is one in my own head all the time about this. About how we all were regular people that were dedicated, and we were able to accomplish these amazing things of driving on the moon in a rover, or walking around picking up rocks. Of course, in the future humans will do all of that, again on the Moon, and Mars, and other places in the Universe that will be –that you could, in fact, walk around, and then they will, hopefully, read the stories and look at the paintings and say, “You know we can do that better.” or, “Well, let’s do more of that.” or, “That’s a good thing to do.” or, “There they made a mistake let’s don’t make that mistake ourselves.” and that sort of thing. It’s just a matter of trying to be one of the giants that future generations [will look back on so that they can] build on [our experiences] as we built on the explorations and discoveries of previous generations.</p></p>

<h2>Trans-lunar Injection</h2>

<blockquote>
  “..frequently if you’re hit by a good bolt of lightning, it’ll jar the airplane, and often you see the flash because it’ll get on the nose. Usually on an airplane it lands on the nose but trails off the wings or the tail usually, kind of goes through you…Then I’d hear Pete and Dick over there. They’re working on their part of the problem, and they start talking about lightning, and that doesn’t mean a lot to me, because I’m still trying to figure out what to do. Then they call to get me to throw a switch…So by the time we got into orbit, we were okay, but it wasn’t because I had done anything that I had learned in training. It turned out that if I’d just done what the ground said, we’d have gotten it faster. The only thing I really used was like a basic thing of being careful if things are going in the right direction. Things were, and we finally got the power on, and then we got up into orbit.”

<blockquote>
  “The switch was fairly obscure, and neither Flight Director Gerald Griffin, CAPCOM Gerald Carr, nor Commander Conrad immediately recognized it. Lunar Module Pilot Alan Bean, flying in the right seat as the spacecraft systems engineer, remembered the SCE switch from a training incident a year earlier when the same failure had been simulated.”

<h2>Left-Brain: Process & Workflow</h2>

<p>After deciding what subject to work on, Bean will use model mock-ups complete with directional lighting as aids. He also works with photographs taken during Project Apollo.</p>

</div>

<p>On occasion, he will take creative license and add astronauts into a piece that were never on the lunar surface. This is the case with his piece “The Fantasy” that portrays Gordon (orbiting the moon during Apollo 12) standing alongside Conrad and Bean on the surface of the Moon.  Bean gives the following explanation on his website, “We often fantasized Dick joining us on the Moon for all the fun, but we could never really find a way. But now I’m an artist and in my paintings I can have it my way. Now, at last, our best friend has come the last 60 miles.”</p>
