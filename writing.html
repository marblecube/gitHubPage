      <h4>THE LATERALIZATION OF LT. CMDR. ALAN BEAN</h4>

      <div class="italic">
      <div class="bold">
        <p>Imagine this: You are being shaken violently by 7.5 million pounds of thrust pushing out of five F1 rocket engines somewhere behind you, and thirty six and a half seconds after lifting off from the Kennedy Space Center atop a Saturn V, every warning indicator on your control panel simultaneously lights up, fuel-cell disconnect flags pop, and your instrumentation malfunctions.</p>
        <p>Seventeen and a half seconds later, the “8-ball” attitude indicator begins spinning wildly, the telemetry stream from Mission Control is garbled, and, since there aren’t any windows, it’s impossible for you to see what’s happening.</p>
        <p>It’s November 14, 1969 and you are one of three astronauts on America’s Apollo 12 mission –the second mission in the history of humankind to venture towards the Moon.</p>
        <p>Your entire life has been prelude to this moment.</p>
        <p>The world is watching.</p>
        <p>You are the spacecraft systems engineer.</p>
        <p>And you have no idea what’s happening.</p>
