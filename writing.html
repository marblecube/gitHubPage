      <h4>SLO-MOTION DESTRUCTO</h4>

      <p>The sky glares;<br />
      angry, ready.</p>
      <p>tap tap tap<br />
      go the big balls of water<br />
      as they dot the ground and</p>
      <p>The sky changes colors.</p>
      <p>Now, she is recollecting the time,<br />
      as a child,<br />
      when the ball knocked her mouth from out her face<br />
      and a single tooth laying upon the black top<br />
      poured smiles up into her eyes.</p>
      <p>Now, the front right tire offers up its last millimeter of rubber and explodes,<br />
      spitting white threads and chunks of tattered midnight.<br />
      The rest squeal and collapse in upon themselves<br />
      gracefully tracing strands of onyxSpaghetti across moistening asphalt.</p>
      <p>The electrical pole, in its grim and solitary, know-it-here-and-now reality,<br />
      possesses planes, layers, frames, opacities, and thicknesses.</p>
      <p>And they (she and it) have been interdependent since before her mother’s mother carried<br />
      a bouquet of daises across an open field and the lumber mill began the dispensing of<br />
      tiny, white envelopes of money to the men.</p>
      <p>The witness is close-by cleaning his responsibility<br />
      and day-dreaming of new shoes and polished book cases.</p>
      <p>The tearing of the air, 
      the microscopic churning of enslaved chemicals,<br />
      the ripping, whistling metal,<br />
      the black and brown wood, splintering</p>
      <p>--he hears these now.</p>
      <p>The seat belt flaps loosely by her side;<br />
      following for a short, quick inch as she pitches forward<br />
      and, with her head, bursts the windshield into<br />
      shimmering, lapus-lazuli jubilee.</p>
      <p>In three and seventeen-twentyfourths seconds,<br /> 
      when he runs up, leaving wet footprints behind,<br />
      he will be exactly 1 minute and 12 seconds away from noticing<br />
      the she will never eat the orange that<br />
      is / are / will be<br />
      strewn<br />
      here and there.</p>
      <p>For now, all he knows is that she is trying to scream<br />
      but only managing softly croaked bubbles of<br />
      bile, phlegm, spittle, and blood.</p>

      <h4>THE LATERALIZATION OF LT. CMDR. ALAN BEAN</h4>

      <div class="italic">
      <div class="bold">
        <p>Imagine this: You are being shaken violently by 7.5 million pounds of thrust pushing out of five F1 rocket engines somewhere behind you, and thirty six and a half seconds after lifting off from the Kennedy Space Center atop a Saturn V, every warning indicator on your control panel simultaneously lights up, fuel-cell disconnect flags pop, and your instrumentation malfunctions.</p>
        <p>Seventeen and a half seconds later, the “8-ball” attitude indicator begins spinning wildly, the telemetry stream from Mission Control is garbled, and, since there aren’t any windows, it’s impossible for you to see what’s happening.</p>
        <p>It’s November 14, 1969 and you are one of three astronauts on America’s Apollo 12 mission –the second mission in the history of humankind to venture towards the Moon.</p>
        <p>Your entire life has been prelude to this moment.</p>
        <p>The world is watching.</p>
        <p>You are the spacecraft systems engineer.</p>
        <p>And you have no idea what’s happening.</p>
